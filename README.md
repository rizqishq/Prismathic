> ⚠️ Project Status: Submitted, but... kinda unfinished

This project was created as part of an assignment — and yes, it’s already been submitted.  
So technically... **mission accomplished**. 🎉

But honestly, there are still a few things that could use improvement or polishing.  
Whether or not that ever happens? Well... that depends on whether laziness loses the battle.
